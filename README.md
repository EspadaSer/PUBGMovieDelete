# PUBGMovieDelete ðŸŽ¥

A Python based application that deletes the PUBG game movies so that the game loads faster.

This program does not provide you any ingame advantage or modify the actual game files in any way. No, you can not get banned from using this.

The program not only saves up your time every single time you run the game, it also helps you to join the game faster if you just had a crash to desktop or freeze and has to launch the game again.

## How does it work?

The program simply removes the movie files of the game. These files are: "LicenseScreen.mp4", "LoadingScreen.mp4" and "LoadingScreen_Xbox.mp4".

## Installation / Usage

This program does not need installation

- Download [latest PUBGMovieDelete from releases](https://github.com/EspadaSer/PUBGMovieDelete/releases)
- Extract the files
- Run PUBGMovieDelete.exe
- A cmd window should appear.
- Try option b first and see if it works. Otherwise choose option a and set up the actual path of your PUBG files.
- Press ENTER to close the program

## Troubleshooting

- You may need to run the program as an administrator depending on the version.
- If you choose the option b, the program will try to automatically detect the location of your PUBG installation and delete the movie files. 
- If autodetect did not work, you will have to use the custom location option. Run the program once and choose the option a. This will create the path.txt file in the same location of PUBGMovieDelete.exe. Close the program and edit path.txt with the actual path of your game install location. Then run PUBGMovieDelete.exe again and choose again the option a.  
- Keep in mind that the program cannot delete the files if they were already deleted
- Steam may download the movie files again when there is a game update. Simply run the program again when this happens.
