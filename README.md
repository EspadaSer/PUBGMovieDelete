# PUBGMovieDelete ðŸŽ¥

A Python based application that deletes the PUBG game movies so that the game loads faster.

This program not only save up your time every single time you run the game, it also helps you to join the game faster if you just had a crash to desktop or freeze and has to launch the game again. 

## What does it do?

The program simply remove the movie files of the game. These files are: "LicenseScreen.mp4", "LoadingScreen.mp4" and "LoadingScreen_Xbox.mp4".

## Installation / Usage

This program does not need installation

- Download [latest PUBGMovieDelete from releases](https://github.com/EspadaSer/PUBGMovieDelete/releases)
- Extract the files
- Run PUBGMovieDelete.exe
- A cmd windows should appear telling you if it could find and delete the desired files. Press any key to close the window.

## Troubleshooting

- You may need to run the program as an administrator depending on the version.
- Depending on the version of PUBGMovieDelete you are using, the program will try to detect where your PUBG game files are located and it will delete the movie files. If for any reason it can not locate the game files, you will have to edit the *path.txt* file generated. This file is located in the same folder where *PUBGMovieDelete.exe* is. Just change the default path for the game to the actual path of your game installation. You will need to run the program again afterwards. Keep in mind that the program cannot delete the files if they were already deleted.
